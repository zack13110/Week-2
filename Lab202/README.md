	# Lab2-2 , design and implement the Course class

Creates Course class in a separate file, e.g. "Course.cs", and implements it to satisfy the following requirements:
- Properties: Name, CourseID, Lecturer, MaxStudents, NumStudents
- Validation: 	CourseID (6-digit number only), 
		NumStudents (0-MaxStudents)
		MaxStudents (0-80, and >= NumStudents)
- Constructors:
	Course(): set default state
	Course(Name, CourseID): takes 2 parameters
	Course(Name, CourseID, Lecturer): takes 3 parameters
	Course(Name, CourseID, Lecturer, MaxStudents): takes 4 parameters
- Methods: 
	ToString(): display object state in specify format (see expected output)


# Testing your class:

After you finish your "Course class", you can test your class with the provided "Program.cs" file.
The result should be similar to the output given as follows:


# Expected Output:
